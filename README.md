# Learning Csharp

This repo includes all programs that I will form while learning the C# language.

This starts off with code from the 50 part AvetisG YouTube C# tutorial. (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLylgIRlJtHWT6iB_c_sumeqIEYJ5GWZqd)

This also includes a TDD tutorial (based on 'FizzBuzz' implementation) that was derived from 'TDD Basics with C#' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4xhTq4qmC0)
